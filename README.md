# Serverless Application With API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB using Terraform

The objective of this project is to create a serverless application with Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda and DynamoDB. We’ll create two lambda functions. Out of which, one function will write datas to the DynamoDB table and the other function will read datas from the DynamoDB table. Moreover, both the functions will be invoked by API Gateway calls. Finally, we’ll deploy this application into AWS Cloud using Terraform.
